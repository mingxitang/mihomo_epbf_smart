# eBPF inbound port map

Source repository: `TanakaLun/mihomo`, branch `ebpf-inbound`.
Target baseline: `MetaCubeX/mihomo`, branch `Alpha`.
Target feature branch: `ebpf-inbound`.

Baselines:

- Upstream: `Alpha` at `1af24e989c157dd506f0456b859e5bb5f3166bc1`
- Downstream before rebase: `ebpf-inbound` at `b1843ef975d23e73616d1610cbb47efb62d3214d`
- Downstream after rebase: `ebpf-inbound` at `d2937811` before the documentation/CI commits in this task

## Migration decision

Only commits required for the cgroup eBPF transparent inbound were carried over.
The old merge commit `ce8b5906` was dropped and the branch was rebuilt linearly on
the current upstream `Alpha` baseline. The historical `component/ebpf`
implementation was not copied; this branch contains the current transparent
inbound implementation under `common/ebpf` and `listener/sing_ebpf`.

The merge commit `ce8b5906` is intentionally absent from the target history.
Upstream changes are applied through the linear rebase instead.

## Rejected commits

Historical eBPF commits that were removed upstream or are unrelated to the
current transparent inbound design were not migrated:

- `31f4d204 support ebpf`
- `bb413ece Merge pull request #144 from zhudan/ebpf`
- `97270dcb rm EBpf tun && disable android ebpf`
- `d3b88d1b fix: ebpf support`
- `0793998d chore: drop support of eBPF`

## Generated files

`common/ebpf/native/shared_network.bpf.o` is generated from
`common/ebpf/native/shared_network.bpf.c` and is intentionally not committed.
CI runs:

```bash
make ebpf_generate
make ebpf_check
```

`ebpf_check` fails when the checked-in source and generated object drift, so the
generated artifact remains traceable to its build command.
